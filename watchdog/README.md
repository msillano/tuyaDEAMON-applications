Some devices disconnect and do not reconnect by themselves (hung up). This can be very dangerous in a remote unattended system, especially in the case of routers or gateways.

A possible solution is to use a relay that momentarily interrupts the power supply to the device: on the restart, usually, the device should reconnect.
