### tuyaDEAMON model for applications

When designing applications, the TuyaDEAMON model simplifies as in the figure (in green the data, in black the commands). This doesn't mean that when developing an application one shouldn't sometimes intervene at a low level, to adapt some properties. Still, the application project is logically 'above' this simplified model of TuyaDAEMON.

The two most essential interfaces for applications are highlighted: REST and database.

The [REST](https://github.com/msillano/tuyaDAEMON/wiki/tuyaDAEMON-REST) interface allows us to send any command (SET) and to send requests to know the last value of each property (GET). The format is straightforward and above all the same for all devices: `device[, property[, value]]`.
</td></tr></table>

- The device's know-how is crystallized in [documentation datasheets](https://github.com/msillano/tuyaDAEMON/tree/main/devices),  which are generated by [tuyadaemon.toolkit](https://github.com/msillano/tuyaDAEMON/wiki/tuyaDAEMON-toolkit), with information on `DPs` (device's attributes or methods), valid values, any quirks.<br>
Some activities are handled by TuyaDAEMON with the _Tuya-cloud_ collaboration: in this case, the two-way communication takes place via [TuyaTRIGGER](https://github.com/msillano/tuyaDAEMON/tree/main/tuyaTRIGGER), but in a completely transparent way for the user, and the documentation is always in the datasheets of the devices, [e.g. Smoke_Detector](https://github.com/msillano/tuyaDAEMON/blob/main/devices/Smoke_Detector/device_Smoke_Detector.pdf).

<table><tr><td> Of the <a href="https://github.com/msillano/tuyaDAEMON/tree/main#database-interface"> DataBase </a>, only one table affects the applications and contains the historical log (commands and events) of TuyaDAEMON: `tuyathome.messages`. The record comprises complete information.<br> example:<br>
