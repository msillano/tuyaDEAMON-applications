### step 1: fine tuning tuyaDEAMON

To tailor the flow and tuyaDEAMON to achieve a well-populated 5-minute database 'energy' view while dealing with lazy devices and verbose devices, I used the following approaches:

1. Verbose Devices (Too Much Data):
 - A [BreakerDIN](https://github.com/msillano/tuyaDAEMON/blob/main/devices/BreakerDIN/device_BreakerDIN.pdf) is used as differential breacker on the house electrical switchboard, and as grid power meter. The problem is that it send data every second, and I haven't found a method to reduce the throughput of the device. 






   - Implement data filtering mechanisms to reduce the amount of unnecessary data stored in the database. You can define rules or conditions to discard or aggregate data based on its relevance or importance.
   - Use data summarization techniques to condense verbose device data into more manageable and meaningful representations. This can involve statistical methods or aggregation functions to extract key insights or trends from the data.
   - Set up data retention policies to limit the storage duration of verbose device data. Determine the appropriate duration based on your requirements and discard older data to keep the database view relevant and manageable.

1. Lazy Devices (Too Little Data):
   - Implement a mechanism to detect when a device is not providing data regularly. You can set a threshold time interval and check if the device has not sent any data within that timeframe.
   - For lazy devices, you can introduce a fallback mechanism. If a device is deemed lazy, you can populate the database view with default or interpolated data based on the previous known values until new data arrives.
   - Consider setting up notifications or alerts to monitor the devices' activity and take appropriate action if a device consistently fails to provide data.

2. Verbose Devices (Too Much Data):
   - Implement data filtering mechanisms to reduce the amount of unnecessary data stored in the database. You can define rules or conditions to discard or aggregate data based on its relevance or importance.
   - Use data summarization techniques to condense verbose device data into more manageable and meaningful representations. This can involve statistical methods or aggregation functions to extract key insights or trends from the data.
   - Set up data retention policies to limit the storage duration of verbose device data. Determine the appropriate duration based on your requirements and discard older data to keep the database view relevant and manageable.

Additionally, you can apply general techniques to optimize the flow and tuyadaemon:

- Implement data compression techniques to reduce the storage space required for each data entry, especially for verbose devices.
- Optimize the database schema and indexes to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of data.
- Use caching mechanisms to improve performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
- Employ batch processing or stream processing techniques to handle data ingestion and processing efficiently.

By combining these approaches and customizing them based on the specific characteristics of your lazy and verbose devices, you can tailor the flow and tuyadaemon to achieve a well-populated 5-minute database view while effectively managing the quirks of different devices.
